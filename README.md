This repository is a placeholder for materials around the forthcoming workshop.


## Things to install

* Rstudio Desktop, preview version [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
Installing this will automatically install the latest `R` version `4.1.0`, which we need.

optional, but recommended to install:
* `git` [https://git-scm.com/downloads]()https://git-scm.com/downloads No need for a separate `git` program. We'll just use it from `Rstudio` a bit.
* `latex` [https://www.latex-project.org/get/](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)  Alternatively we can install it straight from `R` using the `tidytex` package.
